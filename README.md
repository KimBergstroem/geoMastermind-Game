## User Experience (UX) 🔵

### User Stories 🔹

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* As a user, I want to understand the game just by looking at it, so I can play without needing additional information.
* As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game effectively.
* As a user, I want to receive confirmation if my answer is correct, allowing me to increase my score and perform well.
* As a user, I want to see the remaining time while playing, so I don't run out of time.
* As a user, I want to view my final score to assess my proficiency.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* As a user, I want to see if anybody beat my score in order to play again and be number one at this game.
* As a user, I want the option to play again to improve my previous score.

## Design 🔵

### Colour Scheme 🔹

![geoMastermind WebbApp Colour Palette](docs/colorPalette.png)

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment of the universum, so we have chosen a variety of Blue(<b>water</b>), Green(<b>nature</b>) and Yellow(<b>sun</b>) for our site.

This colors are going to be implemented as <b>60-30-10</b> rule with the base of the color #0E304F. We want to have a more dark theme on the website, along with the light colors.

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/aeffd8-8affc1-8fdc97-ac8887-9f4a54).

### Typography 🔹

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* "Lato" is used for headings and bigger content on the site. It is a sans serif typeface family.

![LatoBlack900](docs/fontstyleBlack900Lato.png)

* "Nunito" is used for the body text, paragraphs which are the questions and answer. Nunito is a sans-serif typeface designed by Vernon Adams. It has a rounded, friendly and modern style, and its letterforms are clean and legible.

![PoppinsRegular400](docs/fontstyleNunito.png)

### Imagery 🔹

All the images displayed in this site was originelly downloaded by the sites below mentioned in Credit, Media section, and modified by me in Photoshop.

### Wireframes 🔹

![geoMastermind Web app Overview](docs/wireframes/wireframeOverview.png)

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. I used the webbapplication called [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/suu74na/psiivfn/r6B57) for creating the wireframes for webbapplication <b>geoMastermind</b>.

## Features 🔵


### Accessibility 🔹

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
* Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
* Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

| Script.js | Couldn't get my images right in the array that would be displayed in every question. | Solution was the root and also change to display with tring html "image.innerHTML = currentQuestion.image; - image.classList.add("quiz-image");" |
| Script.js | When clicking on a question, even if it was right or not, user had chance to click on other questions as well. | Added: "button.disabled = true;" so when the user has clicked or answered, the other buttons will be disabled. |  
| Script.js | The "Next button" was showing all the time while the question was displayed and the button can easily be clicked by mistake and enter next question without any answer or score of user. | Hide the button until the answer is answered or once one button is clicked, then the "Next button" will show for entering next question. | 
Script.js | How to stop the timer when a user clicked on the answer button | Just added the "clearInterval(counter);" in my selectAnswer function. clearInterval was learned here [wc3](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_clearinterval.asp). |
