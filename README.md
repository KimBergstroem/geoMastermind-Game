## **Design**ðŸ”µ
&nbsp; 

### **Colour Scheme**ðŸ”¹

![geoMastermind WebbApp Colour Palette](docs/screenshots/readme-color-palette.png)

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment of the universum, so we have chosen a variety of Blue(<b>water</b>), Green(<b>nature</b>) and Yellow(<b>sun</b>) for our site.

This colors are going to be implemented as <b>60-30-10</b> rule with the base of the color #0E304F. We want to have a more dark theme on the website, along with the light colors that are going to be reflected as different world elements.

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/aeffd8-8affc1-8fdc97-ac8887-9f4a54).

&nbsp;
### **Typography**ðŸ”¹

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* "<b>Lato</b>" is used for headings and bigger content on the site. It is a sans serif typeface family.

![LatoBlack900](docs/screenshots/readme-font-lato-black900.png)

* "<b>Nunito</b>" is used for the body text, paragraphs which are the questions and answer. Nunito is a sans-serif typeface designed by Vernon Adams. It has a rounded, friendly and modern style, and its letterforms are clean and legible.

![PoppinsRegular400](docs/screenshots/readme-font-nunito-light300.png)

&nbsp;
### **Imagery**ðŸ”¹

All the images displayed in this site was originelly downloaded by the sites mentioned in Credit section, Media section and was modified by me in Photoshop or in canva.

&nbsp;
### **Wireframes**ðŸ”¹

![geoMastermind Web app Overview](docs/wireframes/wireframe-overview.png)

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. I used the webbapplication called [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/suu74na/psiivfn/r6B57) for creating the wireframes for webbapplication <b>geoMastermind</b>.

## **Features**ðŸ”µ
&nbsp;

### **Future-implementations**ðŸ”¹

In the future, there will be exciting plans to enhance this project. The focus will be on improving the scoreboard to make it clearer and visually more appealing. A new scoring system that incorporates a timer and to add a variety of different game modes to enhance the overall experience. These enhancements will make the project more engaging and enjoyable for users.

* **Scoring system**, will take into account the speed at which the user answers questions, as well as the number of correct answers. This means that the final score will be determined by how quickly and accurately the user responds.

* **Scoreboard page**, users will be able to create a unique profile with a username and the option to select a profile picture. This addition will not only personalize their experience but also contribute to a visually pleasing HighScore dashboard page. This includes the remaining time for the quiz, the time the user has already spent, and a calculation based on these time values. These additions will provide users with a comprehensive overview of their performance during the quiz along with a more appealing UX design and comparing with other users.

* **Quiz Game**, integrating the Google Geography API with the quiz questions. This integration will allow for a dynamic and ever-changing quiz experience. Instead of a fixed set of questions, the quiz will draw from a larger pool of questions stored in the API along with images from the Google Maps system.<br>
Each time a user presses the "Start" button, the quiz system will randomly select 10 questions from the API. This randomness ensures that the quiz is different every time and prevents users from memorizing the questions and scoring a perfect 10/10 on subsequent attempts. By introducing this variability, users will have a more engaging and challenging experience, as their knowledge of geography will truly be tested.

* **Game mode**, increase 2-3 different categories, providing users with a choice of topics. These category options could include Countries, Landmarks, and Country Flags for example.<br>
Users will be able to select their preferred category before starting the quiz. For instance, if they choose the Countries category, the quiz will exclusively present questions related to different countries around the world. Similarly, if they select Landmarks, the quiz will focus on famous landmarks from various locations. Lastly, the Country Flags category will test their knowledge of country flags.<br>
By offering these diverse category options, users can explore different aspects of geography and engage in quizzes tailored to their interests. This variety will add excitement and encourage users to play multiple mini quizzes, enhancing their overall learning experience.


&nbsp;
### **Accessibility**ðŸ”¹

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
* Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
* Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

| Script.js | Couldn't get my images right in the array that would be displayed in every question. | Solution was the root and also change to display with string html "image.innerHTML = currentQuestion.image; - image.classList.add("quiz-image");" |
| Script.js | When clicking on a question, even if it was right or not, user had chance to click on other answers as well. | Added: "button.disabled = true;" so when the user has clicked or answered, the other buttons will be disabled. |  
| Script.js | The "Next" button was constantly visible while the question was displayed, and it could be easily clicked by mistake, causing the user to move to the next question without providing an answer or earning any score. | Keep the button hidden until the user has provided an answer or until one of the answer buttons is clicked. Once a button is clicked, the "Next" button will appear, allowing the user to proceed to the next question. Code fix: "nextButton.style.display = "block";" | 
Script.js | How to stop the timer when a user clicked on the answer button | Added the "clearInterval(counter);" in my selectAnswer function. clearInterval was learned here [wc3](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_clearinterval.asp). |      
Script.js / index.html | When user clicks on Exit Button(Home) in the quiz game, it is not reseting the game when the user pressing Start button once again | Perhaps it's not the optimal solution, add a link attribute directly in the HTML code of the index.html page. When a user clicks on the exit button, it takes them back to the index.html page, effectively reloading the main menu with the start button, just like it was at the beginning. |

| Script.js | If you refresh the browser while playing the game with browser refresh button, you will be redirected back to the main menu, and the game will be reset, effectively turning it off. | When user refresh webbrowser, the page will still display the current quiz game and take user back to main menu. | 
| Script.js | Sometimes, the timer runs slower, and the displayed time does not accurately correspond with the question. | Better way of coding the timer that are currently used. |  
| Script.js | Automatically arrange the usernames in descending order of their scores, so that the user with the highest score is listed at the top in the highscore dashboard. |Incorporate a comparison function that takes into account the score attempts and compares them with the attempts made by other users.|
